# Covid_19_App
This is a platform for Malawi Covid daily updates
And I have used this API https://github.com/stanulilic/mwcovid-api to get data from the daily updates. 
And I have implemented the whole project in kotlin and some sources from the internet to get to know more about covid.
However I have used the CardViews and recyclerViews to implement the layout.
