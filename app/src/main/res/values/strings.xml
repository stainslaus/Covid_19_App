    <string name="covid_detail_one">Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment.</string>
    <string name="covid_detail_two">However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention.

Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. \n\nThe best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when itâ€™s your turn and follow local guidance.</string>
